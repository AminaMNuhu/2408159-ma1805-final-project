MY PLAN FOR NARRATIVE DEVELOPMENT
To further the narrative of my game I plan to implement scenes separate from the gameplay, such as a start screen, end screen, win screen and lose screen. Each scene will be triggered by something the player does. For instance, if the player collides into an enemy/villain (in my game this will be an aquatic snake) there will be an animated or still scene saying they’ve been bitten and consequently lost the game. I also plan to develop my game’s narrative by adding a coin and score counting system (similar to Chrome Dino) as well as a system of lives, which the player can simultaneously gain and lose while playing the game. I also intend to add triggered dialogue to assist the player and add an educational element to the game with facts about each aquatic sprite. 
I also plan to add finishing touches to my game by adding audio elements. This includes background music and sound effects triggered by collisions. For example, a ‘ping’ sound for each time the player collects a coin. 

THEMES I WISH TO EXPLORE
As I mentioned adding a system in the game that gives the player lives that they can gain and lose while playing, the main theme I wish to explore in my game is survival of the player (fish) against what is essentially an underwater obstacle course. 


IMAGES INSPIRING MY AESTHETIC APPROACH
My main aesthetic inspirations for this game was the Chrome Dino game as well as Super Mario Bros 3. Both games use pixel art like aesthetics. Particularly super mario bros 3 as it is a 1980s game from the retro genre.


ACCOUNT OF GAME DEVELOPMENT 
I began the development of this game by creating all the pixel art for the game’s sprites and assets for an underwater ocean themed game. I used software such as Pixilart and Adobe Photoshop to achieve my pixel art, all of which is attached to the game folder and can be viewed individually on there. I then implemented my pixel art onto the game by beginning the coding process on Visual Studio Code. To aid my coding process I followed the module’s demo to create a side scroller tile map-based game, as well as, many Javascript coding YouTube videos and other resources online.
